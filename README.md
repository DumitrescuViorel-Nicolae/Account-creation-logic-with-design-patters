# Account-creation-logic-with-design-patters

This is a simple game account creation logic implemented with java builder and strategy design patters.
It contains an account class that can be configured with flexibility adding to its builder fields such as id, email, the type of soldier and state like online/offline.
The different types of soldiers can be implemented using the strategy design patter, by implementing the defined interfaces. More logic and functionality can be added
to these types with flexibility.
